# SkillBlocker

This addon adds little lock buttons to your Skills menu. Locked skills cannot be cast to ensure that Inner Light or Repentance stays in your bar only for stats. No more accidental casts!

Features:
* Lock skills on both bars independently
* Handlers for temp bars like Werewolf form and Volendrung
* "Unlock all" hotkey
* Per-character locked skill memory (can be disabled)
* Configurable alerts on locked skill cast attempt

Feedback is very welcome!

_Due to how ESO executes skill casts, and addon API limitations, 100% effectiveness is not possible (at least to my current knowledge) so locked skills may still fire if you mash buttons too hard. Fixing this is my #1 priority._
